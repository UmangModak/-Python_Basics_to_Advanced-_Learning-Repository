#string : In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes ' ', double quotes " ", or triple quotes ''' ''' / """ """.

# Single-line strings

# Multi-line string using triple quotes

It can span multiple lines without using \n.
Useful for documentation and long text blocks."""

#integer : In Python, an integer is a whole number—positive, negative, or zero—without any decimal point. It's represented by the built-in data type int.

x = 10           # positive integer
y = -5           # negative integer
z = 0    



# float : ChatGPT said: In Python, a float (short for floating-point number) is a number that has a decimal point. It's used to represent real numbers and allows for more precision than integers.

a = 3.14        # positive float
b = -7.0        # negative float
c = 0.0         # zero as a float

# variable 

'''

A variable in Python is a named storage used to hold data that can be referenced and manipulated later in your program. Think of it as a label for a value.


Rules for Naming Variables:
Can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_)

Must start with a letter or underscore (not a digit)

Case-sensitive (Age and age are different)

Should not use Python keywords (e.g., if, for, True, etc.)

'''

name = "Umang"       # string variable
age = 25             # integer variable
height = 5.8         # float variable

# variable types 

'''
global variable : 
A variable declared outside any function is global. It can be accessed anywhere in the program.

'''
count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    count += 1

increment()
print(count)

'''


local variable : 

A variable declared inside a function is local. It only exists while the function runs.
'''

def greet():
    message = "Hello"  # local variable
    print(message)

greet() 


'''
Comments are notes in your code that the Python interpreter ignores. 
They help explain what the code does and make it easier to understand for you and others.
'''

# This is a single-line comment
x = 10  # This sets the value of x to 10
x

'''
Python doesn't have a native multi-line comment syntax, but triple quotes '''''' or'""" """)
are commonly used for block comments or documentation.
'''

'''
This is a multi-line comment
spanning several lines.
Useful for long explanations.
'''
print("Hello, Python!")
