    "### Operator in Python used to do an operations on variables and values. Operators are a  basically a standard symbol used to a logical and arithmetic operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operators comes with two standard term 1. operator and 2. operand\n",
    "\n",
    "1. operator  : it is used to do a operations using arithmetic and logical operations using standard symbols.\n",
    "2. operand   : it a value o which operator are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Operator \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arithmetic Operations : It is used to do Arithmetic Operations on the values and variables.\n",
    "   1. add (+)             : It is used to add  two variables.\n",
    "   2. subtract(-)         : It is used to subtract two varibles.\n",
    "   3. multiply (*)        : It is used to multiplication of two variables.\n",
    "   4. Divide (/)          : It is used to divide two variable and perform operation division. Result are in float form after division.\n",
    "   5. floor division (//) : It is used to do floor operations. Result are in integer form after division.\n",
    "   6. Modulous (%)        : It is used to get the remainder.\n",
    "   7. Exponential (**)    : It returns the power of the value\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Camparison Operator / Relative Operator : It is used to campare the the assign values.\n",
    "   1. NOT Equals to (!=)  : It checks the value is given to a variable is right or not. if its right the returns false other wise true\n",
    "   2. Greater than (>)    : It is used to check the operands are greater or not. It returns True if the value is greater.\n",
